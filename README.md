My MySQL queries - SwiggyProject.sql


Wrote multiple MySQL queries to answer business questions which could help an investor choose which chain of restaurants, which cities to invest in using GROUP BY, ORDER BY, Common Table Expressions, etc.

Some of the questions are as follows:

Which city has the highest number of restaurants? (Biggest Revenue Base)

Which restaurants have an average rating higher than 4.5? (Most-Popular)

Which is the most popular cuisine? (Most-demand)

Which restaurants are performing better than the average restaurant? (Investment Option)
